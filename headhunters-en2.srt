<i>My name is Roger Brown.</i>

<i>"I'm 5'6" tall.</i>

16

<i>You don't need a Ph.D to realize
that I overcompensate for my height.</i>

17
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:02,230
<i>For instance,
my house is worth 30 million kroner.</i>

18
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,929
<i>I don't like it
and I can't afford it. But she...</i>

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,460
Of course you have to come!

20
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,029
<i>She loves it.</i>

21
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,940
How often does one
of your girlfriends open a gallery?

22
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,104
<i>I told her
I had inherited the money.</i>

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,637
<i>I had to give her
some kind of explanation.</i>

24
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,546
<i>But all I've inherited is bad genes.</i>

25
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,451
We've gone through a long and intricate
process to reach the truth in this case.

26
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,979
<i>For someone like me to get what he
wants, only one thing matters...</i>

27
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,650
Money.

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,886
Go ahead, open it.

29
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,656
<i>Lots of money.</i>

30
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,033
<i>But there is one thing
Diana wants more than anything else.</i>

31
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,204
<i>And that is exactly the one thing
I do not want to give her.</i>

32
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,477
- Isn't she cute?
- Real cute.

33
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,187
<i>You see, Diana Strum-Eiiassen is
one of those tall, smart beauties.</i>

34
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,782
Hi, guys! The large paintings go
to the back, okay?

35
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:05,193
<i>The type used to being loved.
The type who take love for granted.</i>

36
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,757
<i>And there are plenty of men
who would love her.</i>

37
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,790
<i>"Men taller than 5'6 ".</i>

38
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,797
<i>But soon my time will come.</i>

39
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,505
<i>My opportunity. I can feel it.</i>

40
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,104
<i>In the meantime,
I play for high stakes.</i>

41
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,310
<i>If you don't gamble, you don't win.</i>

42
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,213
What are your plans
for tomorrow?

43
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,783
- Why?
- We have a dinner invitation.

44
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,254
We're invited to dinner.

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,297
We are invited to dinner?

46
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,165
Yes. There's someone
I want you to meet.

47
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,295
Are you telling
others about us, Lotte?

48
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,306
There's just someone
I'd like you to meet.

49
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:52,333
This ends right here and now.
I'm really sorry about it.

50
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,539
- Please don't.
- No no no, Lotte!

51
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,741
- We don't exist.
- Please stop.

52
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,594
An impressive resumé
you've got here, Lander.

53
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,567
Thank you. Yes, I believe
I'm the right man for Pathfinder.

54
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,497
I would like to hear a bit about
your life outside the job as well.

55
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,164
Is there such a thing?

56
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,569
So you live here in Oslo?
And are married to? Thank you, Oda.

57
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,207
Camilla.
We've been married for nine years.

58
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,274
- Two kids. They are in school.
- Does she hold a job?

59
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,411
Yes. At a downtown law firm.

60
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,752
Nine-to-five, every day?
Who stays home if the children fall ill?

61
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,223
She does, of course.

62
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,385
So there's no maid
at home during the day?

63
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,553
- No.
- Dog?

64
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,893
- Do we have a dog? No.
- No? Allergic?

65
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,363
No.

66
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,412
How much would you consider that your
reputation as a leader is worth, Lander?

67
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,416
My... reputation?
What do you mean?

68
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,911
This work is by Julian Opie

69
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,386
and is worth a quarter of a million.

70
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,980
Do you own any art
in the same price range?

71
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,718
Actually, yes.

72
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,125
A Munch lithograph.
"The Brooch."

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,391
Could you estimate
its value just by looking at it?

74
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,399
- Well, I'm not sure.
- You're not sure.

75
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,129
This one, for instance,
consists of a few circles and lines.

76
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,932
The coloration is monotone
and without texture.

77
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,768
The only thing...
I repeat, the only thing...

78
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,002
that makes this work worth
a quarter of a million

79
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,668
is the artist's reputation.

80
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,906
And your point is
the same thing goes for leaders?

81
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,504
Exactly.

82
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,442
Which is why
you will not take this job.

83
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,847
- What?
- My God. You applied for it yourself.

84
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,462
What else was I supposed to do?

85
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,262
You should have had
someone tip us off about it.

86
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,291
and then pretended you didn't know
about it when we got in touch.

87
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,826
But...

88
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,100
It's all a game, Lander.

89
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,302
Listen. Pathfinder's chairman
and finance manager

90
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,505
will be here tomorrow,
and I'd like you to meet them.

91
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,810
You're going to listen politely to them,

92
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,647
then you will explain
why you are no longer interested

93
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,120
- and wish them good luck.
- But I would not seem serious.

94
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,987
No. They will see you as ambitious,

95
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,117
as someone
who knows his own worth.

96
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,125
Lander...

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,161
- This is your opportunity.
- Opportunity?

98
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,897
Let me build your reputation

99
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,839
and I promise you a position which
quintuples your income within two years.

100
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,866
- Within two years?
- Within two years.

101
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
How can you promise this?

102
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:46,144
Because I have never given a client
a recommendation he hasn't followed.

103
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,051
- Never?
- Never.

104
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,055
But how?

105
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,079
The answer starts with an.

106
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:57,356
- Reputation?
- My entire career is based on it.

107
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,589
Hi.

108
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,560
- Yes?
- I set you up for the interview

109
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,071
with Jeremias Lander and Pathfinder
tomorrow at 12 o'clock.

110
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,735
- The information is in the file.
- Great.

111
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,573
But listen,

112
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,672
your wife is opening her gallery
this weekend, and I wondered...

113
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,944
could I attend?

114
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,578
- Are you invited?
- Exactly my question!

115
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,248
' Am I?
' Are you...,

116
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,552
<i>I got an invoice of 357,000</i>

117
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,686
<i>for redecoration
in Kasper Hansen Street.</i>

118
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,026
- Yes, <i>that's correct.</i>
- <i>Well, what's that about?</i>

119
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:37,023
I helped Diana with some expenses.
She opens her own gallery on Friday.

120
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,401
<i>You have to start cutting down
on your expenses, Roger.</i>

121
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,565
<i>You may go bankrupt at any time.</i>

122
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,438
I'm working on it, Frode.
I'm working on it.

123
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,705
<i>As your accountant,
it's my duty to inform you</i>

124
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,643
<i>about the seriousness
of the situation.</i>

125
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,582
<i>You have overdrawn your account by several
hundred thousands for dinners...</i>

126
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,381
There's a call coming in here.
I'll call you later.

127
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,889
We have a candidate.
Jeremias Lander, lives at Skoyen.

128
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,726
Okay. Got him. When?

129
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,255
He has a meeting at Alfa tomorrow at 12.
It will last one hour.

130
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,462
- Nobody home?
- No dog, no maid, wife works downtown.

131
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,335
See you in 20 minutes.

132
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,821
<i>The fence in Gothenburg
demanded 50%.</i>

133
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,001
<i>Ove Kjikerud charged 20%
to disconnect alarms,</i>

134
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,970
<i>fetch the an' in my garage,
and bring it to Sweden by car.</i>

135
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:58,169
<i>To get him employed at Tripolis was
one of my smartest moves.</i>

136
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,575
<i>I myself was left' with 80,000.</i>

137
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,443
<i>80, 000.</i>

138
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,506
<i>Not even enough for my next
quarterly payment on my house.</i>

139
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,613
<i>Something had to be done.</i>

140
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,622
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

141
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,128
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

142
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,741
It's looking real good.

143
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,108
Not even half of the guests
have arrived yet.

144
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,636
But I don't have the time
to greet anyone either because...

145
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,377
Listen, it's going just fine.

146
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,875
- Congratulations. Fantastic exhibition.
- Thank you.

147
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,388
- Something crazy happened today.
- Like what?

148
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,255
I cannot tell you now,
but I want you to meet him.

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,759
Meet who?

150
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,972
So this is my husband, Roger Brown.

151
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,572
- Clas Greve.
- Nice to meet you.

152
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,107
Clas just moved here
from the Netherlands.

153
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,144
Excuse me.
Hi, are you on your way?

154
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,784
No, a few screaming kids
just liven up the party...

155
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,594
So what brings you
to Norway? Work?

156
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,860
No. I inherited
my grandmother's apartment.

157
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,663
- She was Norwegian?
- Yes.

158
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,638
And a few months ago,
I chose to go into early retirement.

159
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,264
So now I've moved here

160
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,968
- to redecorate the apartment.
- So you retired?

161
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,374
- Yes.
- From what?

162
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,709
I was the CEO
of a Dutch technology company.

163
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,706
I work with GPS sales.

164
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,345
Dutch?
Not HOTE, by any chance?

165
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,820
Yes, exactly.

166
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,121
Weren't they just bought up
by a large American company? Amtech?

167
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,753
- You are also in the business?
- No.

168
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,131
But why did you quit?
Isn't it exciting?

169
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,827
I won't bore you with job chatter.

170
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,736
I'm in the recruitment business.
You won't bore me with job chatter.

171
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,500
Are you familiar with Pathfinder?

172
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,841
Yes, of course.
They were our competitors.

173
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,544
Roger, I'm sorry, I have to go.
But enjoy the rest of your evening.

174
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,543
Clas! Pathfinder seeks a new manager.

175
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,887
Someone who can stand up
against foreign takeovers.

176
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,892
- How about a meeting?
- Sorry, Roger.

177
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,986
Then let's have lunch.
Monday at 12:00.

178
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,998
We could drop the job chatter
and talk about other things...

179
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,694
art, redecoration,
Polish handymen.

180
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,567
Could I have a pen?
I'll write down the restaurant's name.

181
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,072
You're not used
to being turned down?

182
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,742
A farewell present
for long and faithful service?

183
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,009
No, I stole it.

184
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,776
See you then.
Give my regards to your charming wife.

185
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,551
I will.

186
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,235
- This is my husband.
- Roger Brown. Nice to meet you.

187
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,605
- Brede Sperre, Kripos.
- Yes, we've seen you on TV.

188
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,701
He investigates
alt burglaries now.

189
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,575
I thought you investigated
murders.

190
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,410
Yes, but this is getting so big
that we sent in all our resources.

191
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,747
We're going to stop this now.
Are you in the alt business as well?

192
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,222
No, I work as a headhunter.
In the recruitment business, for Alfa.

193
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,485
I see. One of the partners.

194
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,719
What do you mean?

195
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,491
Well, I complimented your wife here
on her expensive earrings.

196
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,429
She said they were
a present from you.

197
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,228
Yes.

198
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,770
The best of us
get good bonus deals.

199
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,739
I wish we had those
in my line of work as well.

200
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,245
' Sperre...:
- Yes?

201
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,406
We're from VG.
Could we have a photo?

202
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,279
Of course.

203
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,981
Hi. How nice of you to come.

204
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,698
Roger? Are you coming?

205
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,474
Look at this.

206
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,640
"The Calydonian Boar Hunt,"
by Rubens.

207
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,312
It was stolen when the Germans looted
the gallery in Antwerp in 1941.

208
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,188
It's been missing ever since.
Do you know where it is now?

209
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,384
No.

210
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,360
In Clas Greve's apartment
in Oscar Street.

211
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,853
- What?
- Clas Greve's grandmother had

212
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,300
a secret love affair
with a German officer during the war.

213
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,532
But he was arrested
and shot a few days later.

214
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,336
She panicked, fearing someone
would discover the relationship.

215
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,468
And then she hid the painting?

216
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,638
- Yes, something of the sort.
- Oh well, but it's not genuine.

217
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,138
I don't think German officers
collected reproductions, Roger.

218
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,209
Well, why did he tell you about it?

219
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,381
He came by the gallery
to ask if I could evaluate it

220
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,322
or if I knew someone who could.

221
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,586
You're saying that
Clas Greve has a genuine Rubens

222
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,063
hanging in his apartment
in Oscar Street?

223
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,224
- Yes.
- Here in Oslo?

224
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:27,169
Yes. But I offered
to contact an alt museum

225
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,332
to have it moved as soon as possible.
Next week.

226
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,333
You don't place a painting
like this in a safe-deposit box.

227
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,406
How much do you think it's worth?

228
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:42,246
Tens of millions.
Maybe a hundred.

229
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,560
Do you know what I think?
I think we should celebrate.

230
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,759
Celebrate what?

231
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:01,363
That you opened your own gallery.

232
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,903
And the two of us.

233
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,410
Thanks for supporting me, Roger.

234
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,209
Everything is going to be fine.

235
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,181
What do you mean?

236
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:17,186
That you and I should
start thinking about the future.

237
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,966
- Ove here.
- We have a candidate.

238
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,438
Do you know what the time is?

239
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,999
<i>His name</i> is Clas <i>Greve.
He lives in 25 Oscar Street.</i>

240
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,942
What, he is grave?

241
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,775
No, his name is Greve.

242
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,478
Ove?

243
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,512
Ove, what's happening? Ove?

244
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,023
Sorry. Natasha is here.

245
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,753
Come again?

246
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,351
<i>Meet me at the cabin tomorrow.</i>

247
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,795
No, not tomorrow! It's Saturday.

248
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,661
I've got her for the whole weekend.

249
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,496
We want to do something nice.
Not tomorrow.

250
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,435
This is a big deal, Ove.
We only have a couple of days.

251
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,441
- One o'clock!
- Yes, okay.

252
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,116
- You are so sweet.
- Good morning.

253
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,326
- Listen.
- Yes?

254
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,232
What you said yesterday
about the future.

255
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,966
- Yes?
- Does it include the sound

256
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,441
of tiny feet
shuffling along these corridors?

257
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,845
- Maybe.
- Don't give me "maybe," Roger.

258
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,145
I told you yesterday
that everything will be fine,

259
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,848
- and it will.
- But I want that conversation now.

260
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,117
Definitely, but I have
an important meeting first.

261
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,023
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Hmm?

262
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,757
- You have an important meeting?
- Yes.

263
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,198
A meeting that was
set up during the night?

264
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,169
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

265
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,168
- What are you so scared of?
- Nothing.

266
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,542
I'm scared of dogs
and you when you are like this.

267
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,739
Don't just make jokes about it.

268
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,839
If you want us to be childless
the rest of our lives,

269
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,178
I would really like to know.

270
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,116
Didn't you hear me?
We'll have the conversation,

271
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,051
but not now because I have
an important meeting.

272
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,385
I've tried to talk about this
for seven years, Roger.

273
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,585
And it will take another seven years
if you keep nagging this way.

274
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,828
I didn't mean that.

275
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,628
You will never give me a child.

276
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,319
So... how many millions
are we talking about?

277
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,387
Maybe up to a hundred.

278
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,724
A hundred?

279
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,123
- This happens every time, Ove.
- Eh?

280
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,261
I've told you I don't like
those things lying around.

281
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,431
Don't start again.
You know I always carry weapons.

282
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,067
At home,
I've got weapons everywhere.

283
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,600
Got a gun
within reach in every room.

284
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:32,514
You should get one as well.
Sooner or later they'll be coming.

285
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,347
We do it this way:

286
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,979
You go to Gothenburg
and get a reproduction.

287
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,148
There are many available,
but we need a good one.

288
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,488
I have lunch with Clas Greve on Monday.
Then I will get...

289
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,890
Ove?

290
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,540
Women.

291
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,810
Like I tried to say before I was
interrupted by a Russian prostitute,

292
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,342
I have lunch with Greve on Monday.

293
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,180
I'll find out then
when the apartment is empty,

294
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,380
so that I can fetch the painting.

295
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,117
You go to Sweden immediately. Now.

296
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,217
Okay. No, shit, I can't.

297
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,489
- What?
- I'm busy.

298
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,155
- Busy?
- Natasha is here.

299
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,791
I'm making a film with her
before she goes back.

300
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,459
Film?

301
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,162
I've arranged everything
with the guys at work.

302
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,172
- They've changed shifts and everything.
- You're filming her?

303
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,902
It's such a long time between her
visits, so I need something to watch.

304
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,311
I just activate the alarm,
and the cameras start rolling.

305
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,817
- She doesn't know you're filming her?
- No way.

306
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,154
And the Tripolis guards?
They are watching the two of you?

307
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,490
The cameras are not directed
towards the bed!

308
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,324
What do you take me for?

309
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,592
They see her undress

310
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,362
and a bit of fingering.

311
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,432
She's cut her hair. Looks nice.

312
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,535
The rest is private. Cool, eh?

313
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,283
The painting will be removed from
the apartment in just a few days, Ove.

314
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,684
Do you realize how big this is?

315
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,949
She is here twice in six months.

316
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,684
You'll be left with millions.

317
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,386
With that kind of money
you can buy her.

318
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,092
For the rest of your life.

319
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,568
I'll have one without scampi jelly,
and dressing on the side.

320
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,301
As you wish. Thank you.

321
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,301
Will you settle in Oslo now
or will you do a lot of commuting?

322
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,651
Three and a half million,
plus stock options.

323
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,455
I'm afraid you take things
for granted, Greve.

324
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:29,653
Don't forget you're a foreigner.
Norwegian companies would like...

325
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,527
Roger. I don't doubt that your methods
will work on most people.

326
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,293
And I respect that, of course.

327
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,994
But we have both been
in this situation before.

328
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,596
- You practically dribbled over me on...
- Dribbled?

329
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,335
You drooled when we met at the gallery,
and with good reason.

330
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,277
On that occasion, the problem
was not that I was a foreigner,

331
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,302
but that I was not interested in a job.

332
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,043
But you get to reflect a lot
during a weekend, and I concluded

333
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,280
that redecoration is not
that interesting in the long run.

334
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:00,620
So if it's okay with you,
why don't we simply drop the charade?

335
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,888
I surrender.

336
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,300
But I still need more data on you.

337
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,633
- For my client.
- Do you play squash?

338
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,374
Are you married?

339
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,350
- Divorced.
- Children?

340
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,045
- Unfortunately not.
- Dog?

341
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,747
Yes.

342
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,814
I've got one.
He is in Amsterdam.

343
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,416
- In quarantine?
- I'll fly down to get him tomorrow.

344
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,431
The GPS business is a tough one?

345
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,905
- Your back.
- Oh.

346
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,432
- That's from the army.
- The army?

347
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,877
I enrolled when I was 18.

348
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,678
After a few years I was enlisted
in an elite unit which specialized...

349
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,686
- Specialized in what?
- Tracking.

350
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,087
- Tracking of?
- People.

351
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,785
Missing people, fugitives.

352
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,454
And the technology
came from HOTE?

353
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,520
Exactly.

354
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,692
They produced
microscopic transmitters.

355
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:21,568
I had some ideas for improvements,
so they recruited me.

356
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,937
Where did you get those scars?

357
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,636
Bolivia.

358
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,872
And how?
Were you tortured or what?

359
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,244
No, I was lucky.
I got out in time.

360
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,476
Sounds like something from a film.

361
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,985
Believe me, Roger.
You've never seen this on film.

362
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,713
When do you think we can arrange
a meeting with Pathfinder?

363
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,385
Any time.
When are you back from Amsterdam?

364
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,486
- The day after tomorrow.
- Let's do it then.

365
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,934
Diana?

366
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:59,532
<i>Out with customers Back late.</i>

367
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,554
No, Murphy. Come here.

368
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,292
<i>Hit the ring, hit the ring!</i>

369
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,667
<i>Hit the one you want,
hit the one you love.</i>

370
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,586
<i>Hi, this is Diana.
I can't answer the phone right now,</i>

371
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,646
<i>but you know what to do
after the beep. Have a nice day.</i>

372
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,943
- Hi.
- Hi.

373
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,383
- You're so late.
- I tried to call your cellphone.

374
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:18,478
Right. I can't find it.
I must have left it at the gallery.

375
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,781
Was there anything urgent?

376
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,190
No.

377
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,989
I just wanted to hear your voice.

378
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,863
That's sweet.

379
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,870
Come and sit down.
This film just started.

380
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,371
No.

381
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:40,807
I'm beat.

382
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,709
I'm going to bed.

383
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:54,818
We developed this jelly containing
hundreds of transmitters per milliliter.

384
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,519
It adheres to all materials.

385
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,254
It's invisible
and just about impossible to remove.

386
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,024
- You mean Trace.
- Exactly.

387
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,429
The disadvantage is that Trace

388
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,162
is hypersensitive to dirt and mud.

389
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,831
And my personal experience as a soldier
is that when you're stuck in,

390
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,569
pardon my French,
the asshole of the world,

391
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,874
you are dependent
on your equipment.

392
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:24,048
Being introduced by Brown
is obviously of great significance.

393
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,023
In the final stage, he has to
give us his recommendations.

394
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,827
Excuse me for a moment.

395
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,212
Great meeting.
Thanks a lot.

396
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,804
- Really good.
- Thank you so much.

397
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,543
- Take care.
- Thank you.

398
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,415
When will you write
the recommendation?

399
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,686
- We have to make a decision first.
- What was that?

400
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:06,090
Nothing is decided.
There are other candidates.

401
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,757
We have to consider the total picture.
We will get back to you.

402
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,630
Damn it, Roger,
did we attend the same meeting?

403
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,829
It couldn't have been better.

404
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,531
They were ready
to sign the contract on the spot.

405
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,574
Well, then your chances are good.

406
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,517
<i>- Hi.
- Shit, are you calling on a cellphone?</i>

407
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,985
- You're going to Gothenburg tonight.
- <i>What?</i> Tonight?

408
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,785
The painting has to be traded
for money, as quickly as possible.

409
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,804
- Hi.
- Hi.

410
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,810
I have to talk to you.

411
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,812
You can't look me up this way, Lotte.

412
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,575
Please, just give me two seconds.

413
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,192
I'm sorry if it's my fault
you're feeling this way.

414
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,826
There's really nothing more
to talk about.

415
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,395
Nothing at all.

416
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,638
Do you need money?

417
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,406
I miss you.

418
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,348
- I miss you so much.
- Lotte.

419
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,409
Lotte.

420
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,012
Don't contact me again.

421
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,440
You look tired.

422
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,172
Thank you.

423
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,812
Anything wrong?

424
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,147
No.

425
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,448
- A lot to do at work?
- Quite a bit.

426
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,391
I had a meeting today with Pathfinder.
And Clas Greve.

427
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,520
- Did it work out fine?
- No.

428
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,929
- He won't get the job?
- Definitely not.

429
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,028
When I get to the office tomorrow,
I'll call all the other agencies

430
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,767
and make sure
he won't get a single job in Norway.

431
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,503
Why is that?

432
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,312
- By the way, did you find your phone?
- Pardon?

433
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,610
Your cellphone.
You said you lost your cellphone.

434
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,209
- Yes, I did.
- Was it in the gallery or what?

435
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,915
- Yes.
- That's great.

436
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:49,322
- Some more wine?
- Yes. Thank you.

437
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,148
Ove?

438
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,283
Ove?

439
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,456
Ove?

440
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,913
Come here.

441
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,942
Hi.

442
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,606
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

443
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,985
I saw you go down here,
and you didn't come out.

444
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,818
- I got a bit worried.
- About what?

445
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,653
Nothing.

446
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,756
- Roger.
- Yes.

447
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,897
Have a nice day at work.

448
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,874
I love you.

449
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,575
Ove? Ove?

450
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,923
- Ove, where do you live?
- Nathas...

451
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,399
- Not Natasha. Where do you live? Ove?
- Nathas...

452
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,698
Ove? Ove?

453
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,931
Ove? Where do you live?

454
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,490
Ove, what happened in the garage?

455
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,254
Did you see anyone?

456
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,801
Ove, answer me. Ove?

457
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,997
Did you see what happened?
Was there anyone there?

458
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,336
Listen!
Was there anyone there, Ove?

459
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:41,241
Was there?

460
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,413
What the hell is going on here?

461
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,248
Shit, what's going on?

462
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,302
- Ove, what's the password?
- Eh?

463
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,812
What's the password?

464
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,179
- What's the password for the alarm?
- Nata...

465
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,979
We have to deactivate the alarm.
What's the password?

466
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,384
- Nata...
- Stop going on about her!

467
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,446
- What's the password?
- That's what I'm saying. Natasha!

468
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,295
With "sh" or "sch"?
Ove, "sh" or "sch"?

469
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,038
Ove?

470
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,239
Ove? How is it going?

471
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,012
Ove, how are you doing?

472
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,749
- What happened?
- You sat on a syringe in my car.

473
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,381
A syringe?

474
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,886
- Relax. You were lucky.
- Lucky?!

475
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,226
It must have hit your knee, so that
you didn't absorb all the poison.

476
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,391
- You didn't expose us?
- No way.

477
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,526
- Did you fuck up?
- That's not what this is about!

478
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:16,663
- You didn't fuck up, did you?
- Diana is having an affair with Clas.

479
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,436
He wouldn't kill you
just because he fucks your wife!

480
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,914
- Call 911!
- We don't want the police here!

481
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,523
Please, Roger.

482
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,083
I need to get to a hospital,
or else I'll die.

483
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,220
- I'll get you some milk.
- Eh?

484
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,254
Milk neutralizes poison. That's what
they would do at the hospital.

485
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,595
Then give me milk!

486
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,220
- Call them.
- Don't do anything stupid, Ove.

487
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,223
Then I'll do it myself.

488
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,727
Just calm down now.

489
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,429
Roger! I would like
to talk to you.

490
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,386
No!
' Roger?

491
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:40,941
<i>Our main research interest
was the tracking of people.</i>

492
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,944
<i>Microscopic transmitters.</i>

493
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,152
Hello. I just thought
I'd visit the cabin.

494
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,220
I thought you were Kjikerud.

495
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,698
- No.
- It's his car.

496
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,598
Yes.

497
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:51,532
Aren't you some kind
of businessman?

498
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,838
I was fired.
May I park the car inside the barn?

499
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,574
- 500 per 24 hours.
- 500?

500
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,776
You could park for free
by the roadside, you know.

501
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:15,420
If you touch the tractor,
I want compensation!

502
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,955
What a rush of people here today!

503
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:53,894
- I'm just visiting Roger Brown.
- You mean that businessman?

504
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,301
Yes.

505
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,603
- What do you want from him?
- We have an appointment.

506
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:03,975
What you're all doing up there
is none of my business,

507
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,108
but he probably didn't invite you
for coffee and cakes in the cabin.

508
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,674
In the cabin?

509
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,778
Yes, and since it's my property,

510
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:17,656
maybe a slight compensation
would be fair?

511
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,618
Search!

512
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:29,300
Hello?

513
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,359
Who are you?

514
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,598
Oh shit.

515
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,740
You're not supposed
to be out of bed.

516
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,537
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No.

517
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:06,570
Get back to bed.
Well, except for the police.

518
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,379
- Huh?
- They're waiting in the corridor.

519
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,349
I told them you should
have your breakfast first.

520
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,576
Because if you manage to smash
the larynx, you're a good fighter.

521
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:44,676
Experienced. Ever heard
about something called ko-daw-ying?

522
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:49,588
No wonder. Do you know
how many martial arts there are?

523
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,593
Three thousand. Three thousand.

524
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,012
You've got wushu,
martial arts from China.

525
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:21,614
Tahtib, Egyptian stick fighting.

526
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:25,026
That's him! That's him.
He's running away!

527
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,789
Hey! Hey!

528
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,994
Freeze! Freeze!

529
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,470
Sunded, I've got him!

530
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,134
Hi. My name is Olav Sunded,
from Kripos.

531
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,510
You are a suspect in the murder
of the farmer Sindre Aa.

532
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,379
Come with us, Kjikerud, and we'll go
through the rest at the station.

533
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,849
What?

534
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,784
You are Ove Kjikerud?

535
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:56,318
Yes.

536
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,744
Where are we going?

537
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,715
We're going to Elverum Police Station,
for questioning.

538
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,550
And I hope you cooperate, so that
I can go back home to Oslo tomorrow.

539
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,215
<i>Attention all patrol cars.</i>

540
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,882
In other words, both of them.

541
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,260
Bravo 3-0 here.

542
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,092
<i>Egmon Karisen has reported
his truck stolen.</i>

543
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,725
Did Karisen sound sober? Over.

544
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,757
<i>Not exactly. Over.</i>

545
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,669
Call Bamse Pub.
It's probably parked there. Over.

546
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,866
Maybe it's parked behind Kiwi.

547
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,932
Why did you kill
the farmer, Kjikerud?

548
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,602
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

549
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,168
Don't even try.

550
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,204
Your Mercedes was parked
in Sindre Aa's barn,

551
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,183
and you drove
his tractor into a ditch.

552
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,879
- I've never heard that name.
- We have several witnesses who saw...

553
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,717
<i>There is no truck
parked outside Bamse Pub.</i>

554
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,690
No, but I've got
more urgent matters now. Over and out.

555
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:06,660
- But, Kjikerud...
- Maybe you could check behind Kiwi.

556
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:12,289
- We have several witnesses who...
- Damn, there it is!

557
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,970
Brugd here. Call Egmon.
I can see his truck now.

558
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:19,462
Probably his son stole it again. Over.

559
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,465
What are you doing, Brugd?

560
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:33,284
Well, like I said, Kjikerud,
we have plenty of evidence,

561
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,721
and still you deny everything.

562
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:40,251
So start feeding me details,
because you lost me completely.

563
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,428
Aa's neighbour found you
in the ditch beside the tractor.

564
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:52,234
<i>We developed this jelly containing
hundreds of transmitters per milliliter.</i>

565
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,899
<i>It adheres to all materials.</i>

566
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,739
<i>Its invisible,
and just about impossible to remove.</i>

567
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,267
<i>I love you.</i>

568
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,311
You just sit there repeating
the same thing over and over again.

569
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,786
- We have to get out.
- No, we don't have to get out.

570
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:09,483
- He's going to kill us all.
- Relax, Kjikerud.

571
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,492
He has rubbed
transmitters into my hair!

572
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,824
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- We have to get out!

573
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,796
- Calm down.
- He wants to kill me!

574
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,627
He rubbed transmitters into my hair!

575
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:19,496
We have to get out!

576
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,832
- He's going to kill me!
- Calm down!

577
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:25,829
- We have to get out!
- No, we don't have to get out.

578
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,260
<i>Hi, this is Diana.</i>

579
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,060
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

580
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,536
<i>Roger? Is that you?</i>

581
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,376
After finishing here,
we go to Forensic.

582
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,743
- Yes.
- And then we'll have

583
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,441
a look at Kjikerud's house.

584
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,406
Eh?

585
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,983
"Hi, I'm a single girl from Gjovik."

586
01:11:56,011 --> 01:12:00,050
I think you are Norway's
most sexy policeman, and the best.

587
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,995
"Would you like to meet me?
I agree to just about anything."

588
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,443
What the hell happened here?

589
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,149
Lotte, wait. Wait.

590
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,318
- What are you doing here?
- Please let me in.

591
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,352
- What happened to you?
- I need help. Please.

592
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,423
Thank you.

593
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,696
I don't mean to involve you in this.

594
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,135
In what?

595
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,995
When they ask, don't lie.

596
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,635
Just tell them I was here.

597
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,548
Tell them I forced my way in.

598
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,380
What happened?

599
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,476
Wait here, okay?

600
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,989
I'll get something to clean it with.

601
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,958
Have you got a pair of scissors?

602
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:41,156
Lotte, who are you contacting?

603
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,060
- Give me that phone!
- Ow!

604
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,725
- Give me that phone!
- Stop it. Stop.

605
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,893
"Roger is alive.
He is in my apartment now."

606
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,925
It's not what you think!

607
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,906
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

608
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,738
- Answer me! Answer me!
- No, I don't know. I don't know.

609
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,869
- What's happening?
- It's not my fault!

610
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,504
What's going on?

611
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:02,141
- Please.
- What does Greve want from me?

612
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:06,943
- It's the Pathfinder job.
- You don't kill people for a job!

613
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,685
It's about billions, okay?

614
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:13,852
They've been working on this for months,
ever since they found out that.

615
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,294
- Pathfinder is looking for a new CEO.
- Who are they?

616
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,889
- Who are "they"?!
- Clas.

617
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,924
He still works for HOTE.

618
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,732
What?

619
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:29,706
- What?
- They have massive economic problems.

620
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:32,109
Amtech can save them.

621
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,410
They demand that HOTE provide them
with Pathfinders' technology.

622
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:37,246
- This was Clas' assignment.
- Are you all insane?

623
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:45,391
I was to get to know you,
then introduce you to him.

624
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,486
But he found a new plan, when you
suddenly didn't want to see me any more.

625
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:52,329
- What plan?
- He had to find a way to meet you.

626
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:58,268
His grandmother had an old reproduction
of a Rubens painting.

627
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,330
So he made up a wild story

628
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:03,275
that she had gotten it
from a German officer during the war.

629
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:07,542
He looked up Diana and told her
the story, and she believed him.

630
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:09,982
Then he met you.

631
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:16,355
The only thing I've done
is rub transmitters into your hair.

632
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,018
Did you do that?

633
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,724
Did you smear
that shit into my hair?

634
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,658
- Diana?
- Huh?

635
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,328
- Is Diana involved in this?
- I don't know, but I think so.

636
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,497
- You think so?
- It's not my fault!

637
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,667
I didn't want this to happen!

638
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:42,946
I just want to get away from him.

639
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:45,645
Please help me.

640
01:15:58,153 --> 01:15:59,860
May I have a glass of water?

641
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:34,424
Lotte! Lotte!

642
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,722
<i>The suspect in the farmer murder case
died in the accident,</i>

643
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:34,091
<i>with three of the four
police officers.</i>

644
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,427
<i>The last police officer
is still missing.</i>

645
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:41,832
<i>Military divers are now searching
in and along the river at the site.</i>

646
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,894
<i>Now to the Middle East, where...</i>

647
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,678
Diana.

648
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,154
Roger?

649
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,426
What happened?

650
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,034
Are you okay?

651
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,970
Don't look at me that way.

652
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,506
I know why you left.

653
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,714
There's nothing more
between Clas and me now. I promise.

654
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,451
I tried to tell you in the garage,
but I couldn't.

655
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,356
- And then you just disappeared.
- Diana, what do you know

656
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,486
- about everything that happened?
- No, I have to tell you this now.

657
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,362
I didn't want it to happen,

658
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,890
but you hurt me,

659
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,062
he was so easy to talk to

660
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,530
and I couldn't stand it any more.

661
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:05,416
It was wrong, and I'm so ashamed.

662
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,820
Because you are the one I want.

663
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:15,261
If you really think we shouldn't
have children, we don't need to.

664
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,798
I'm willing to do anything.

665
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,372
You really do love me.

666
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,603
You must never doubt that.
Promise me.

667
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,415
And you didn't know anything?

668
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:41,883
- About what?
- You didn't know anything.

669
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:52,022
Oh my God.
What has happened?

670
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,091
Come here.

671
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:36,736
Dog bites are very serious, Roger.
You have to see a doctor.

672
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,972
It's not that convenient right now.

673
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,775
Hold this.

674
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:50,114
What are you planning to do now?

675
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:52,921
I don't know.

676
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,665
They'll soon find out
who died in the accident.

677
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,630
I have to remove evidence.

678
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,175
And then?

679
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,309
I have to get away from here.

680
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,785
Make a new start.

681
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,788
Maybe we...

682
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,657
maybe you and I could...

683
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,400
I can wait awhile
before I report it stolen.

684
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:50,038
I have to clean these too.

685
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,888
Did you love her?

686
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,351
No.

687
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,978
How could you be
so god damn stupid? Eh?

688
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,940
Steal works of art?

689
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,347
To buy things I don't need?

690
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,424
Who do you think I am?

691
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:50,535
You had asked me

692
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,170
what I'm scared of.

693
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:02,716
And I've been scared
since I first met you.

694
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:06,282
I've been scared
that you would leave me.

695
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,422
Scared that we would have a child

696
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,626
which you would love more than me.

697
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:22,138
And I've been scared that you would
see me as I really am

698
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,139
and hate it.

699
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:37,675
<i>I need to see you.
Diana</i>

700
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:40,982
I'm sorry about this, Greve.

701
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,420
It's quite all right.

702
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:46,017
Roger Brown is on an unexpected
journey abroad, you see.

703
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,052
That sounds exciting.

704
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,859
Yes, he had to save
an important contract.

705
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,865
But you are in safe hands now.

706
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:58,030
There are only formalities left,
so it won't take very long.

707
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:04,271
Hi, we are supposed
to change a fan in B4.

708
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:07,508
- Yes.
- We've been in and out the whole day,

709
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:09,412
but this card doesn't work.

710
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,847
Yes, but just wait
until the other guy comes back.

711
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,411
Who then?

712
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,389
<i>PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT.</i>

713
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,840
<i>AUTOPSY.</i>

714
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:31,028
Thank you.

715
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:17,642
Hello, guys.

716
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:21,112
- Hi.
- Sorry, but we're a bit behind here.

717
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:25,140
A lady just got in who's been lying dead
on heating cables for two weeks.

718
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:28,220
Have you got any thoughts on this?

719
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:31,349
Typical car accident injuries
on both of them.

720
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:33,154
The cause of death
is internal hemorrhages.

721
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:34,751
But where are the peanuts?

722
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:39,330
It says here there was
a bag of peanuts. Where is it?

723
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:41,732
I certainly didn't eat them, Sperre.

724
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:44,532
Has anyone been in here?
Anyone unauthorized?

725
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:47,233
To steal a bag of peanuts?

726
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:28,738
Who's that?

727
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:39,108
What the hell is
going on here, Roger?

728
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,053
Are you removing evidence?

729
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,321
Do you think
you can get away with this?

730
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,558
What the hell?

731
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,397
So you realized
that stuff about the hair?

732
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:01,202
That it's where
the transmitters were?

733
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,675
Lotte placed them there.

734
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:09,106
- That's why you killed her?
- Does it feel like a loss?

735
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:11,378
- I'll give you a choice.
- That Lotte died?

736
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,410
If you tell me
what the hell is going on,

737
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:15,853
I'll shoot you in the head.

738
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:17,686
If not, you'll get
a bullet in your stomach.

739
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,191
Don't you have
any feelings regarding this?

740
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:20,749
Why do you want to know?

741
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:24,491
Because I would like to know
if people like you really exist.

742
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:26,829
- People like me?
- Yes.

743
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:30,392
People who are not capable of love.

744
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,098
People without empathy.

745
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:34,231
- Empathy?
- Yes.

746
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,941
If you want the answer,
just look at yourself in the mirror.

747
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:40,172
- No.
- Yes.

748
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,181
- I'm not like you.
- You're not?

749
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,046
No.

750
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:47,017
I have loved someone.

751
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:50,022
You have loved someone?
Diana?

752
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:52,547
You have loved her?

753
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,855
I'm afraid I have bad news for you.

754
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:08,271
She tells me she longs for me.

755
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,776
She wants me.

756
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,705
And I'm only human.

757
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:18,410
Have you ever loved anyone?

758
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,441
Except for your dead dog?

759
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:25,324
I have no time for this, Roger.

760
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:27,451
I've got an appointment
with Diana tonight.

761
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,828
You fetched the hair.
You knew I'd be coming for you. Why?

762
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:33,730
A shot in the stomach
means a slow death.

763
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:37,463
You'll beg me to kill you.
So I ask you for the last time:

764
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:41,565
Why am I here?
What are you smiling at?

765
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:44,406
Why am I here?
Hold it right there!

766
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:58,317
<i>What happened now?
He was shot! What happened?</i>

767
01:32:02,617 --> 01:32:04,858
Do you know why I was smiling, Clas?

768
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,998
Because you just proved
that Diana loves me.

769
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:14,232
She didn't come to you
because she wanted you.

770
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,674
She came to you
to put cartridges in your pistol.

771
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,871
She replaced
the cartridge in your pistol

772
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:24,315
with an empty cartridge.

773
01:32:25,339 --> 01:32:28,877
Or what do you call them
in Danish? Blanks?

774
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,651
What are you talking about?

775
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:32,385
She hates you.

776
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:35,560
She wants you to die.

777
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:44,203
But I will give you one chance.

778
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:51,703
I have no idea how many bullets
Diana managed to switch.

779
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,847
This is not like you, Clas.

780
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,753
Is it over?

781
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:14,824
Yes.

782
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:32,069
<i>I may not know myself I
but I know others.</i>

783
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:33,578
<i>And that's what I gambled on.</i>

784
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:37,845
Welcome to this press conference,

785
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:40,648
arranged by Oslo Police District
and Kripos.

786
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:43,219
<i>I had prepared well.</i>

787
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:46,815
<i>The pistol I took
from the crash site</i>

788
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:49,020
<i>would be found by the police
on Kjikerud's bed table...</i>

789
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:52,190
<i>the same pistol
that killed Lotte Madsen,</i>

790
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:54,699
whom the press presented
as Greve's lover.

791
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:58,831
<i>How the "art burglars"
Ove Kjikerud and Clas</i> Greve

792
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:00,634
<i>killed each other
in a bloody shootout...</i>

793
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:02,504
The alarm has gone off
over at Ove's place.

794
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,873
<i>Was watched
by the whole world on the Internet.</i>

795
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,478
<i>The police would also find
that the pistol Greve fired</i>

796
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:19,048
<i>matched the one which fired
the bullet that penetrated Ove's head.</i>

797
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,390
<i>He should never
have picked up that pistol.</i>

798
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:24,953
We are pleased to present
a breakthrough in the case.

799
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:27,226
<i>But even though
I had done everything right,</i>

800
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:29,234
<i>there was one thing
I could not change.</i>

801
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:33,764
<i>Ove was already dead
when I shot Greve.</i>

802
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,476
<i>But Brede Sperre is
Norway's most renowned investigator.</i>

803
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:41,503
<i>Leaving cases unsolved
is not his style.</i>

804
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:43,980
<i>Especially not after
VG called him:</i>

805
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:46,075
<i>"The man who makes
Norway sleep well at night.</i>"

806
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:49,051
<i>Because he is competent?</i>

807
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:50,919
<i>Obviously.</i>

808
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:55,155
<i>But mainly because he has realized what
it takes to get ahead in this world.</i>

809
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:56,752
<i>And what would that be?</i>

810
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:59,765
Like I mentioned, this has been
a long, complicated investigation.

811
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,357
<i>The answer starts with an "R.</i>"

812
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:03,265
<i>Reputation.</i>

813
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:07,670
<i>Something that gets you
TV exposure,</i>

814
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,369
<i>and provides you with texts
from unknown women.</i>

815
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:13,606
We believe
they celebrated the theft

816
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:15,545
and that they lost control completely.

817
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:18,743
Because they end up torturing a dog

818
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:23,552
and killing the farmer
who owns the cabin?

819
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:24,783
That's correct.

820
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:26,849
REALTOR OPEN HOUSE

821
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:33,621
Have a nice day. Both of you.

822
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:39,700
We are ready here, Roger.

823
01:36:39,727 --> 01:36:41,365
Send in the candidate
in one minute.

824
01:36:41,395 --> 01:36:42,874
- Yes.
- Ferdinand.

825
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:44,240
Thank you.

826
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:49,473
Hi. I'm sorry.

827
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:51,642
Please sit down.

828
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:55,950
I asked you to come here because
I think we are at the end of a long,

829
01:36:55,976 --> 01:37:00,584
and as you know, dramatic hunt
for Pathfinder's new leader.

830
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:02,423
In the last round,
it was completely unrealistic

831
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:03,985
to have him released
from his present position.

832
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:08,057
Without promising too much,
I believe I have persuaded him.

833
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:09,999
Please welcome.

834
01:37:10,024 --> 01:37:11,560
Jeremias Lander.

835
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:14,697
Nice to see you again.

836
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:18,773
<i>My name is Roger Brown.</i>

837
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:20,779
<i>"I'm 5'6 " tall.</i>

838
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:22,838
<i>And you know what?</i>

839
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,406
<i>That's more than enough.</i>

840
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,540
